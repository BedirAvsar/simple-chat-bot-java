# Simple Chat Bot with Java

This is a simple console-based chatbot project developed as part of the Hyperskill Java learning path. The goal of this project is to strengthen core Java programming skills by building a conversational bot from scratch. Throughout the exercises, you implement small features such as greeting, simple logic, mini-games, and basic arithmetic operations.

## 📌 Project Goals

Through this project, I aimed to reinforce:

- Java syntax and fundamental programming concepts  
- Handling user input in the console  
- Conditional statements and loops  
- Working with strings and basic algorithms  
- Structuring small programs in a clean, modular way  
- Problem-solving through incremental feature development

## 🧠 Features

- Greets the user and initiates simple conversation  
- Age-guessing logic using arithmetic  
- Small word or number guessing games  
- Simple math operations  
- Step-by-step expansion aligned with Hyperskill tasks  

## 🚀 How to Run

Run with Gradle:

```bash
./gradlew run
```

Or compile and run manually with Java:

```bash
javac Main.java
java Main
```
